Point of Sale (POS) System for Rural Spaza Shops

This repository contains the functional specification and planned development for a zero-cost Point of Sale (POS) system specifically designed to empower rural spaza shops like Tembie's in South Africa. The project aims to transition informal businesses towards formalized operations by providing essential tools for sales, stock management, and financial reporting.

Core Philosophy:

    Start Simple, Grow with the Business: The system is built with a modular design, starting with essential functionalities and allowing for future enhancements as the business expands.

    Real-World Constraints: Developed with practical considerations in mind, such as transport limitations and cash flow challenges prevalent in rural settings.

    User-Friendly: Designed for users with varied technical skills, ensuring ease of adoption and use.

Key Features (Core System - Phase 1):

    POS Transaction Engine: Handles sales processing, including barcode scanning support, manual product lookup, multiple items per transaction, quantity adjustments, and transaction void capabilities. It also ensures real-time stock reduction upon sale.

    Flexible Payment Processing: Supports cash and manual card sales, mixed payments, and detailed payment method tracking for reconciliation.

    Screen-Based Receipt Generation: Displays clear, full-screen receipts optimized for customer photography, including all essential transaction details, with future readiness for thermal printer support.

    Comprehensive Product & Stock Management: Manages product information (name, barcode, category, cost/selling price, VAT status, expiry dates) and implements a dual stock level system (monthly and minimum) with reorder alerts. It also tracks all stock movements (sales, manual adjustments, additions) with an audit trail.

    Daily & Monthly Reporting: Provides essential daily cash management features (opening till, sales totals, withdrawals, variance reports) and critical monthly financial reports (Cash Flow, Profit & Loss, VAT reports) and basic business intelligence.

    Robust User Management & Security: Implements distinct user roles (Admin, POS Operator, Stock Manager), role-based access control, activity logging, and password management.

    Detailed Shift Management & Handover: Facilitates formal shift start/end procedures and handovers, including financial, stock, customer, and operational information, with comprehensive audit trails and reporting.

Technical Stack:

    Language: Python 3.8+

    Database: SQLite (embedded, zero-cost)

    GUI: Tkinter (built into Python)

    Platform: Windows/Linux compatible

Future Modules (Planned Enhancements):

    Customer Registration & Credit Management

    Intelligent Reorder Calculator (addressing transport challenges and optimizing purchase quantities)

    Advanced Analytics, Supplier Management, Barcode Scanner integration, Mobile Integration, Loyalty Programs, and Cloud Sync
