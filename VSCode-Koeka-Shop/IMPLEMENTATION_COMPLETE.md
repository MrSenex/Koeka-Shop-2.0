- `archive_product(product_id, user_id)` - Safe archiving (soft delete)
- `restore_product(product_id, user_id)` - Restore archived products
- `can_delete_product(product_id)` - Safety constraint checking
- `get_archived_products()` - List archived products

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `get_all_products(include_archived=False)` - Filter archived products

### 2. User Interface Enhancements (`core/ui/product_management.py`)

**Enhanced Delete Button:**
- Smart deletion detection
- Automatic constraint checking
- Guided deletion process

**New Archive Management:**
- "Archived Products" button

### 3. Database Schema Support

**Automatic Column Addition:**
- Adds `archived` BOOLEAN column to products table
- Graceful handling of existing databases
- Backward compatibility maintained

### 4. Testing and Documentation

**Test Suite:**
- `test_product_deletion.py` - Comprehensive testing
- Covers all deletion scenarios
- Validates data integrity

**Documentation:**
- `PRODUCT_DELETION_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide
- `demo_deletion_features.py` - Feature demonstration

4. Follow the guided deletion process
5. Use "Archived Products" to manage archived items

### For Developers
```python
from core.products.management import ProductManager

pm = ProductManager()

# Check if safe to delete
delete_info = pm.can_delete_product(product_id)

# Safe deletion
if delete_info['can_delete']:
    pm.delete_product(product_id, user_id)
else:
    # Archive instead
    pm.archive_product(product_id, user_id)

# Manage archives
archived = pm.get_archived_products()
pm.restore_product(product_id, user_id)
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_product_deletion.py
```
